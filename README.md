# Coffee Sales Analysis Project in Excel
## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard designed to analyze multi-year coffee sales performance (2019–2022) across products, countries, customers, and purchasing behaviors. The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore trends using dynamic filters such as time period, roast type, cup size, and loyalty card status.

## Analytical Questions / Problems to Solve
- Which coffee type generates the most consistent revenue over time?
- Are there seasonal patterns in coffee sales across years?
- Which countries contribute most to total revenue, and how concentrated is revenue geographically?
- How dependent is revenue on a small group of top customers?
- Do loyalty card holders significantly impact overall sales volume?
- Which product sizes and roast types should be prioritized for inventory optimization?

The primary objective is to support data-driven decision-making in pricing, customer segmentation, inventory planning, and market expansion

## Analysis & Insights
1. Sales Trends Over Time
- Sales show high volatility month-to-month, indicating sensitivity to seasonality or promotions.
- Peak sales occur intermittently, particularly mid-year and toward year-end.
- Arabica and Liberica show higher peaks, suggesting stronger customer preference or pricing power.

2. Coffee Type Performance
- Arabica consistently shows strong performance with higher peaks.
- Robusta appears more volatile with lower average revenue.
- Excelsa and Liberica show niche but periodic spikes.

3. Sales by Country
- The United States dominates revenue, accounting for the majority of total sales.
- Ireland and the UK contribute significantly less, indicating market concentration risk.
- Insight: Revenue is geographically imbalanced.

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize Arabica production and inventory: Highest and most consistent revenue driver.
- Expand geographically beyond the U.S.: Reduce revenue concentration risk by targeting Ireland/UK growth.
- Strengthen loyalty programs: Use loyalty data to push targeted promotions and subscription models.
- Introduce seasonal campaigns: Align promotions with observed peak demand periods.
